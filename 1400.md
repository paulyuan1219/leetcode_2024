# 1460. Make Two Arrays Equal by Reversing Subarrays

## Solution on 2024-10-21
This problem is contained in the Meta interviews tutorial.
The key point is to realize that as long as the two arrays contain the same char sets, they can be made equal by using bubble sort and swap

```python
class Solution:
    def canBeEqual(self, target: List[int], arr: List[int]) -> bool:
        import collections

        if len(target) != len(arr):
            return False

        target_counter = collections.Counter(target)
        arr_counter = collections.Counter(arr)

        for num, freq in target_counter.items():
            if num not in arr_counter or arr_counter[num] != freq:
                return False
        
        return True
```
