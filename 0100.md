# 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
Medium
Topics

Hint
Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:

[4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
[0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].

Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]
Output: 11
Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times. 
 

Constraints:

n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 5000
-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000
All the integers of nums are unique.
nums is sorted and rotated between 1 and n times.

The following code provides wrong ans.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def findMin(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        
        start, end = 0, len(nums) - 1

        while start + 1 < end:
            mid = (start + end) // 2

            if nums[start] < nums[mid]:
                if nums[start] < nums[end]:
                    return nums[start]
                else:
                    start = mid
            else: # indicates nums[mid] < nums[end]
                if nums[mid] < nums[start]:
                    return nums[mid]
                else:
                    end = mid
        
        return min(nums[start], nums[end])
```

```bash
nums = [5,1,2,3,4]
output: 2
expected: 1
```

Though this example, it's obvious that the code above is wrong. The judging criteria is not that simple.

The following code is accepted

```python
class Solution(object):
    def findMin(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        
        start, end = 0, len(nums) - 1

        while start + 1 < end:
            mid = (start + end) // 2

            # this is a trivial case
            if nums[start] < nums[mid] and nums[mid] < nums[end]:
                return nums[start]
            
            if nums[start] < nums[mid]:
                start = mid
            else: # indicates nums[mid] < nums[end]
                end = mid
        
        return min(nums[start], nums[end])
```

Below is my thought
- Case 1: if the whole array is strictly increasing, we will have `nums[start] < nums[mid] < nums[end]`. In this case, `nums[start]` is the minimal value.
- Case 2: if the whole array is rotated somewhere, then the whole array look like the follows. In this case, we can check `mid` value. If `mid` is located on the first line, this means that the minimum will be of the 2nd half. If `mid` is located on the 2nd line, then the minimum will be on the 1st half. That's simple.

```bash
    /
   /
  /
 /
s
       e
      /
     /
```

The code can be further optimized as follows:

```python
        while start + 1 < end:
            # this is a trivial case
            if nums[start] < nums[end]:
                return nums[start]

            mid = (start + end) // 2

            if nums[start] < nums[mid]:
                start = mid
            else: # indicates nums[mid] < nums[end]
                end = mid
        
        return min(nums[start], nums[end])
```


# 162. Find Peak Element
Medium
Topics
Companies
A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 1000
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
nums[i] != nums[i + 1] for all valid i.

The first try doesn't work. Time exceeded

```python
    def findPeakElement(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if len(nums) == 1:
            return 0

        start, end = 0, len(nums) - 1

        while start + 1 < end:
            mid = (start + end) // 2

            # we should check if mid is a peak location

            if nums[mid - 1] > nums[mid]:
                end = mid
            else:
                start = mid - 1 # this part is questionable., should be start = mid
        
        if start == 0 and nums[start] > nums[start + 1]:
            return start
        
        if end == len(nums) - 1 and nums[end] > nums[end - 1]:
            return end
        
        if nums[start - 1] < nums[start] and nums[start] > nums[start + 1]:
            return start
        
        if nums[end - 1] < nums[end] and nums[end] > nums[end + 1]:
            return end
```

Below is a quick fix. The idea is straigtfoward. Just do it.

```python
    def findPeakElement(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if len(nums) == 1:
            return 0

        start, end = 0, len(nums) - 1

        while start + 1 < end:
            mid = (start + end) // 2

            # this following `if` can be commented out. It's still correct.
            if nums[mid] > nums[mid - 1] and nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]:
                return mid

            if nums[mid - 1] > nums[mid]:
                end = mid
            else:
                start = mid
        
        if start == 0 and nums[start] > nums[start + 1]:
            return start
        
        if end == len(nums) - 1 and nums[end] > nums[end - 1]:
            return end
        
        if nums[start - 1] < nums[start] and nums[start] > nums[start + 1]:
            return start
        
        if nums[end - 1] < nums[end] and nums[end] > nums[end + 1]:
            return end
```
